### [Case Study 2: Pizza Runner](https://github.com/naman2398/SQL-Casestudy/tree/main/Pizza%20Runner)

Danny, inspired by the global pizza craze and '80s retro styling, launched Pizza Runner as a visionary fusion of pizza and the gig economy. To secure seed funding for his Pizza Empire, Danny added a unique twist - Uberizing pizza delivery. He began recruiting 'runners' to deliver pizzas from his headquarters (his own home) and developed a mobile app to streamline customer orders, even maxing out his credit card to fund it.

With a background in data science, Danny recognized the importance of data for his business's growth. He's provided us with an entity relationship diagram of his database but needs our expertise to clean the data and perform basic calculations, enabling him to optimize Pizza Runner's operations and guide his runners effectively.

### [Case Study 3: Foodie-Fi's Subscription Streaming Service](https://github.com/naman2398/SQL-Casestudy/tree/main/Foodie%20-%20Fi)

In 2020, Danny identified a niche in the market and founded Foodie-Fi, a unique streaming service dedicated solely to food-related content, akin to a culinary Netflix. Collaborating with a group of tech-savvy individuals, Foodie-Fi introduced monthly and annual subscription plans, granting subscribers unlimited on-demand access to an exclusive library of global food videos.

With a data-driven approach, Danny instilled the importance of data in shaping investment decisions and implementing new features at Foodie-Fi. This case study delves into how the utilization of subscription-style digital data became instrumental in addressing critical business inquiries and steering the growth of the platform.
